                <p class="heading">How does CSS "control" HTML?</p>
                <p>If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a background and white text you would write:
                    <br>
                    h1 {<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;background-color : blue;<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;color: white;<br>
                    }<br>
                    In this example, the h1 is a selector. It says to the browser "I want you to apply the rules I'm about to tell you to every h1 element."<br>
                    After the the h1 there is a left curly brace "{" and at the bottom there is a matching right curly brace "}". Everything between these curly braces will be interpreted as a "rule" that should be applied to every h1 element.<br>
                    The line of code that says "background-color : black;" is a declaration. "background-color" is a property and "black" is the value of that property.

                <p class="heading">How do I include CSS Styling in my webpage?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Method 1: Write CSS in the head tag of your HTML</li>
                    <li>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file (Better method when working on large projects)</li>
                    <li>Method 3: Write your style <em>inline</em> with your HTML</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="heading">Four pointes to box-sizing</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.</li>
                    <li>Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.</li>
                    <li>There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues:</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.</li>
                            <li>Set the <span style=color:red>box-sizing</span> attribute to <span style=color:red>border-box</span> for every element</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="heading">Box Positioning</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divs are <b>block</b> elements (as opposed to <b>inline</b>), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</li>
                    <li> Adding the rule <span style=color:red>display: flex;</span> to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</li>
                </ol>
