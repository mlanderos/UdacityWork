Steps to modifying the DevBranch and then merging changes to Origina Master
1. git checkout <branchName>
2. Make changes to files
3. git add <filename> 
4. git commit -m "message here"
5. git checkout Master
6. git merge <branchname from step 1>
7. git branch -d <branchname from step 1> to delete branch when you don't need it anymore
8. git push origin master


Steps to create a new branch and push it to Github
1. git checkout master
2. git status
3. (If there are changes in master,pull them down) git pull
4. git branch <new Branch name> ##to create a new branch from Master
5. git checkout <new Branch name>
6. Push branch to Github: git push origin <new brach name>
7. Make changes to your branch and push them to new branch: git push --set-upstream origin <new branch name>
8.then follow steps above to merge those changes to Master

If working on Master branch and making changes to Master branch
1. git status (ensure you are on master branch)
2. make changes to file
3. git add <filename>
4. git commit -m "<add commit changes>"
5. git push (this will push your local commits to master branch)
6. git status (should show that the master brach is up-to-date.)
