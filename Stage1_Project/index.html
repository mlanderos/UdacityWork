          <p>Come see <span style=color:green><b><em>Link</em></b></span> you have never seen him before. This game is the largest installment within the entire Legend of Zelda series. 
            You embark on a journey across many different areas; mountains, forests, villages, deserts, caves, seas & more! You can walk. 
            You can ride. You can glide. You can climb. You can swim. Thankfully, you can transport to your required destinations to 
            fulfill your destiny. <br>
            <br>Or<br>
            <br>
            You can put aside the main quest and do what <span style=color:green><b><em>Link</em></b></span> enjoys most. FISH of course! Break pots in hopes to find money and fill your
            pockets. Play mini-games to win cool unrequired items. Because I really need those fashionable boots to complete my journey!
            <br>
